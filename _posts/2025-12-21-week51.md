Last week, I wanted to touch my blog’s layout a bit.
I wanted to keep its simple look, but also wanted to make it a bit more colorful and categorize the weeknotes separately from other writes.
I mostly worked on this and created different versions through the week. I plan to release it soon.

Apart from coding, it was also a sporty week. 
I played in two football matches and also did one run. 
I could not find the motivation to run in the last two or three weeks, but I did not want to be totally disconnected. 
Therefore, this week’s run was a small win for me.
