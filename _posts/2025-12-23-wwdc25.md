title: "WWDC25 Videos I Keep Coming Back To"
subtitle: ""
---

I’ve been reading through my notes that I’ve taken over the year, and I noticed that I made a list of favorite videos from WWDC25 for future reference. I also wanted to share it at some point, but I always put it aside. I think it is never too late to discuss WWDC sessions. I refer to them, sometimes going back many years, very often when I want to learn something that I don’t already have a foundation in.

In general, I think _“What’s New in …”_ or _“Explore …”_ sessions are good introductions to more detailed talks, and they’re always important for building a general understanding of what’s new or the concept.

- [**Principles of Inclusive App Design**](https://youtu.be/pD43DI-VA20?si=0G81mY1DTdlOwFcF)

Accessibility was one of the main topics I focused on this year. I’m also working on this area in my side project, experimenting with engaging multiple senses. This video discusses how your app can be more inclusive, and I think it’s always worth reflecting on these principles.


- [**Profile and Optimize Power Usage in Your App**](https://youtu.be/vccG9jw83I4?si=SMKTAnE8GOU1iUzh)

Performance optimization is another important topic. I closely follow instrumentation-related sessions every year, and this session on power consumption is especially important if users spend a lot of time in your app.

- [**Record, Replay, and Review: UI Automation with Xcode**](https://youtu.be/TI-XF0M8Ge0?si=Co-RM_ANde5ndcJK)

A practical guide to recording and replaying UI tests.

- [**Design Foundations: From Idea to Interface**](https://youtu.be/dGcqqA3Sl-o?si=kUSgG4gC1xKHuM5a)

Design sessions help in understanding the nature of design in Apple products. They help you understand how to approach design—and, also development. This is one of the areas I pay close attention to.



- [**SwiftData: Dive into Inheritance and Schema Migration**](https://youtu.be/OR0C6V6lp1k?si=FrY8-IUaOO_TBa6e)

If you’re using SwiftData, this session contains very important information, especially around migrations.  
It’s possible to define SwiftData models without explicit versions, but once you need to modify those models, you don’t have a versioned schema to migrate from. That trade-off is important to understand.



- [**Meet the Foundation Models Framework**](https://youtu.be/mJMvFyBvZEk?si=uI-JM93aM_4xAU_F)

AI was clearly the most popular topic of the year. The sessions around Apple Intelligence are important to understand the scope and potential use cases of on-device models.

Related sessions on the same theme: 

[Code-Along: Bring On-Device AI to Your App Using the Foundation Models Framework](https://youtu.be/XuX66Oljro0?si=0xsgSn6zoFQhGKjP):
A more practical, hands-on session focused on using Foundation Models in real scenarios.

 [Explore Prompt Design & Safety for On-Device Foundation Models](https://youtu.be/-aMFBj-kwdU?si=20az8T1iWDH5EjM0):
Focused on prompt design best practices and safety considerations.


- [**Dive Deeper into Writing Tools**](https://youtu.be/sH4ka44WTBs?si=GOeHidlGdg_xa3cV)

This is a more niche interest. I like writing and keeping notes, but I often find existing tools distracting and over-featured. Because of that, I’m interested in this topic, especially with the idea of possibly building a minimalist writing tool.


- [**Embracing Swift Concurrency**](https://youtu.be/Ttxz8bVvX3s?si=2LX8iXRZjsTPe3ir)

This topic plays a vital role in modern Swift development. Many concepts have been introduced in recent years, and the complexity has increased significantly. Following these sessions helps in keeping up with modern Swift.

There are many other important sessions from WWDC25, but these are the ones I noted as the most relevant to my current circumstances. I believe these videos are worth revisiting and can benefit anyone who takes the time to watch them.
