title: "Week #43: Morning Hours, Better Days"
subtitle: ""

This week, I wanted to change my daily routine a bit and started working earlier. I usually begin work around 8:30–9:00 and finish accordingly. However, this week, I started between 7:30–8:00, and I noticed positive changes from several perspectives.

I noticed that I felt more energetic, as waking up earlier allowed me to catch the sunrise, and adjusting my sleep schedule improved my sleep quality. This has always been the case for me in the past. Every now and then I change my wake-up time, and this makes me feel more positive and helps me use my time better.

Another change I observed was that I’ve been more productive in the mornings because I get fewer interruptions while working and also can plan my day more easily. Additionally, there’s less work left for the afternoon when my energy is typically lower.

One of the most rewarding aspects of this new routine was ending my workday earlier, which gave me more space for myself. This extra time was also very fruitful this week, as I managed to spare time for many personal tasks throughout the week.
