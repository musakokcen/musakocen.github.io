title: "Week #50: Revisiting Combine and Old Projects"
subtitle: ""
---
This week was mostly about revisiting framework documentation and completing the review of Combine. It felt important since it used to be very popular, and many projects still handle their async works through it. While doing this, I took notes for future reference and also drafted a blog post.

My last side project is getting close to completion. As mentioned before, accessibility features were added recently, and the next step is profiling to ensure everything works as expected.

There was also some progress on an old reading and vocabulary learning project. Several thoughts sparked in my mind, and one evening I wanted to add a macOS target, which turned out far more complex than expected because many modifiers and solutions are not compatible. Though it was not that straightforward, it finally ran on macOS, with lots of UI work still to do.

I finally thought of improving this blog, though its simplicity and look are still appealing. I’m thinking of enhancing the design and adding new sections like TIL and bookmarks for better engagement.
