title: "Week #47: Learning, Antigravity, Fazıl Say"
subtitle: ""
---

I have been working on my personal development in a more organized manner. I try to deepen my knowledge of what I already know, learn new things, and revisit topics I know but haven't touched in a while. This week, I revisited the Combine framework and covered many topics. I plan to continue with it next week, and in December, I plan to start a new topic.

Many people were talking about Gemini 3. I also came across [Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/) and watched this [video](https://youtu.be/nTOVIGsqCuY?si=B0gPv9RNOCZM8ytA.). It looked really cool, so I wanted to give it a try. I downloaded the IDE this weekend and used it to handle several tasks for my side project in Swift, such as localizations. It did a very good job. From my perspective, it is most useful for repetitive and boring tasks, such as translation, because I enjoy handling others myself. Having a tool that can handle repetitive or boring tasks definitely makes working on side projects more enjoyable.

Besides these, I listened to Fazıl Say live for the first time. It was a wonderful [concert](https://www.instagram.com/p/DRY-HUBiBfM/?igsh=NGQwOTdlejliYjM3). You could feel his passion for each piece as he played. Moreover, there was also the world premiere of Dervish Rituals, performed with Ney and Güdüm. It was my first time hearing the Güdüm, and I really liked its sound.
