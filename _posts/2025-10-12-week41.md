title: "Week #41: Running Farther, Brewing Better"
subtitle: ""
---

The gloomy weather this week brought an unexpected sense of focus. I felt productive, grounded, and clear-minded, both at work and in my personal life. I found myself making good progress on complicated issues, and at home, I was able to engage with my books and personal projects efficiently.

I ran my third 10K, something I’d been looking forward to for a while. I’d always focused on improving my 5K time rather than pushing for longer distances. One day, however, I decided to run farther. I started slowly, maintaining a steady rhythm, and resisted the urge to speed up. It was enjoyable, and I felt stronger afterward. My next goals are to reach 15 km and eventually a half marathon.

I’ve been exploring specialty coffee for some time, but I had never managed to brew the perfect espresso until this week. I finally pulled one in 30 seconds with a 1:2 ratio — exactly the taste I’d been chasing. It’s a small thing, but it felt like a real accomplishment.

The new winter cycling gear has made a big difference. I’ve been riding more often, both around the city and on longer gravel tours. The cold air and autumn trails have their own kind of peace, and it’s become one of my favorite ways to clear my mind.
