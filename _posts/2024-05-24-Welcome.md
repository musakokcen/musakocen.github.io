I have been thinking about creating a blog where I can revive my writing habits, share my thoughts and knowledge, and showcase my work. 

In the past, I used to write about everyday topics and I have been writing on [**Medium**](https://medium.com/@musakokcen) since I started to feel comfortable in my profession. 
However, I haven't written for a long time and I want to change that. 

For now, you can find a brief introduction about me and my portfolio of applications I'm working on.

Best regards,
<br>Musa
