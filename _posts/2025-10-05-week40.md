title: "Week #40: Testing Out Winter Cycling Gears"
subtitle: ""
---

Since sunny days also have started getting cold, I've been taking my first rides with my winter cycling gear. I just did two short rides to test it out, and I noticed that even when it felt like the temperature was around 5Â°C, pedaling was actually pretty comfortable. A windproof jacket and gloves make riding way easier, and base layers and a neck warmer make it so much more comfortable. These little adventures really got me going, and over the weekend, a friend and I finished the 54 km gravel route around Starnberger See. The course was a lot of fun, and we rode at a good pace.
