title: "Week #44: Half Marathon Plan"
subtitle: ""
---

I've been running regularly for some time, at least once a week for the past few months. I started with a 5K run, then I sped up, and then I did 10K runs. However, this improvement was not very organized and did not have any planned target. Finally, I want to run a marathon, but I haven't made a plan to do it. Last week, I found an app that lets me make and follow plans. I started with a plan to run a half-marathon and did the first week successfully. This week was my first week, and thanks to my new habit of starting the day early, I can easily find time to run in the evenings before the day gets really dark. The plan lasts for sixteen weeks. I started out with easy 5K and 7K runs in the first week and finished them. I'm excited for the next few weeks and would like to run a half-marathon sometime in the first few months of next year.

The weather was warm and sunny this Saturday, so I took the opportunity to go cycling. It was one of my fastest rides in a while. I finished 55 km in two and a half hours.
