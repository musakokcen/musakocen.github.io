title: "Week #36: Starting weeknotes"
subtitle: ""
---

I’ve been thinking about trying out weeknotes for a while but kept putting it off. The motivation was coming from the thought that weeknotes can be a good way to stay motivated with whatever is being worked on, and also a chance to connect with people who share similar interests. My goal is now to keep this up until the end of the year. Since this is the 36th week of the year, I’m starting there. In this first post, I’ll share a brief summary of what I’ve been doing recently and last week.

The biggest change for me this year has been regaining my ability to concentrate, which has made a huge difference in my life. Slowly, that has started to turn around this year. I’ve been reading as much as I used to, and my passion has returned. At the same time, I’ve been balancing different activities, such as working on side projects, running, cycling, and swimming. Improved concentration is the biggest win for me so far this year — and the reason I can finally write this blog post.

Speaking of new activities, one highlight of the summer has been getting a new gravel bike. I wanted to take long rides around Munich and explore the nearby parks. I ended up with a Cube Nuroad Pro FE 2023, and I've been cycling regularly ever since. It’s quickly become one of my favorite activities again, and I hope to continue it in the winter, along with running and swimming. On top of that, I’ve managed to run at least once a week, usually around five kilometers. My next goal is to increase that distance to 10 kilometers and finish under 60 minutes.

When it comes to my side project, I’ve been thinking about how I could use an app to organize my language learning progress. The main purpose is to keep things organized and encourage me to read more. At the beginning of last summer, I felt overwhelmed and stopped working on it. I’m slowly getting back to it, but the question remains: How do I solve this problem?

This week;  

It was extra special because my brother came to visit Munich, and we got to spend a lot of quality time together. We explored the city, visited beautiful places, and enjoyed each other's company. Honestly, it was one of the best moments of the year for me. Spending time with him also made me reflect on what I love about this city and the places I’d want to show anyone who visits. 

After a couple of days off at the beginning of the week, I went back to work feeling fully recharged. That short break was enough to clear my head and bring my energy back. 

I try to cycle at least once a week, usually on weekends. Even though my plans were different, I usually chose road bike routes because they're more comfortable, but this week I picked a gravel tour in the parks around Dachau and rode 50 km. I also enjoyed gravel cycling and will probably prefer it in the coming weeks.
