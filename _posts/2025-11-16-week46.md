I’ve been tracking my computer use for quite some time, and recently I’ve noticed a clear shift in my habits. I’m using my Mac Mini far less during the week, sometimes skipping days, and even when I open it, I spend noticeably less time on it. I think the main reason is that I’ve started questioning why I’m opening it and what else I could be doing with that time. When I don’t have a specific purpose, I usually end up choosing something more meaningful instead.

I enjoy being in the kitchen almost as much as I enjoy eating. I occasionally cook traditional dishes or variety of desserts. This week I wanted to try something slightly experimental and decided to make _döner_ at home. Naturally, I couldn’t prepare it the traditional way, so I had to improvise. I ended up making it in the oven and actually managed to get the layers impressively thin.

I’ve also been experimenting with new coffees. I ordered one from [La Cabra](https://www.instagram.com/lacabracoffee/) last week. I’ve followed them for a while and have been impressed by their story and transparency. I tried this one throughout the week and enjoyed it. I also spent more time brewing filter coffee, and that switch from espresso-based coffee added to sense of it.
