  I'm Musa
  <p>
    I was born and raised in Antalya, studied educational technology in Istanbul, and have been based in Munich since 2022. I moved through different business fields and finally landed in software development. Since 2019, I've been developing iOS apps with great pleasure.

    During my university years, I blogged, read regularly, took photos with my DSLR, and had a great interest in cinema. I was even into making short films. This life was interrupted by many factors. Now, I want to get back to some of those habits. I'm planning to move away from social media and focus on a clear mind, productivity, and sharing what's important to me.

    I'm going to split my writing into two themes: my profession and other topics such as cycling, hiking, Munich, and maybe photography and cinema.
