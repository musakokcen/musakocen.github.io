  Hello, I'm Musa.
  <p>I grew up in Antalya, studied Educational Technology in Istanbul and have been living in Munich since 2022. I've tried out different jobs over the years, but I finally landed in software development. I've been happily building iOS apps since 2019. Since last year, I have also been doing Flutter with joy.</p>
  <p>When I was at university, I was into blogging, reading, photography and cinema. Life got in the way and I lost touch with a lot of those hobbies. I've been feeling the pull to go back to some of them lately. I haven't really been on social media for a while now. I've been focusing on staying positive and productive instead.</p>
  <p>This blog has two main themes: one about my work, mostly iOS and tech, and the other about all the things I get up to in my day-to-day life, like cycling, hiking, living in Munich, sports and other random stuff.</p>
