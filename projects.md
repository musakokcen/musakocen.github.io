<div class="projects-intro">
<p>I have contributed to the development of mobile applications across large-scale consumer platforms, telephony, sports, and productivity domains, primarily developing iOS solutions using Swift, SwiftUI, and Objective-C, with additional contributions in Flutter.</p>

<p>My work involves ownership of features and modules, contributing to architectural decisions, improving performance and stability, and ensuring maintainable codebases through refactoring and testing. Currently, I am part of a team developing a B2B telephony application with call center management features, where I am responsible for a core module and collaborate closely with cross-functional teams.</p>
