<p>There was a moment in my life when I needed to make a decision for my future. After experiencing different paths, I found myself educating in iOS development. It was a summer when I saw a photograph I had taken earlier and strongly associated it with my journey. I considered that moment as “setting sails for new horizons.” Since then, my sails have been on, and I continue to pushing forward.</p>

<p>I do my work with passion. Solving problems, developing solutions, and finally producing something that people use gives me an undefined satisfaction. It also feels like craftsmanship, like bakers bake bread.</p>

<p>When it comes to this blog, I have been writing for a long time before, keeping diaries, notes, and writing blogs. With this space, I aim to rebuild my writing habit and provide meaningful writing to readers as well. At the time of writing this text, I am close to completing my challenge of publishing weekly notes. Later, there will be less frequent writing, but with more specific topics.</p>
